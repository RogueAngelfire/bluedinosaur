Working with Visual Studio Code

  => ls (list)

	=> cd desktop (selects desktop file)

	=> mkdir bluedinosaur (this creates a folder called bluedinosaur)

	=> cd bluedinosaur (selects the folder)

	=> python3 -m venv venv ( creates a file venv)

	=> ls (check the listed file venv exists)

	=> source venv/bin/activate (This will activate the virtual environment - to check this works => which python )

	=> pip list

	=> pip install django (this will install django)

(Django will install)

ls ( This will show manage.py)

python3 manage.py runserver

(you will see local server and add to browser)

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

(Note 18 unapplied migration(s)  Therefore add the following:

python manage.py migrate

Ok will appear along side each migration.

I encountered an issue of the app missing manage.py so I added the following => django-admin startproject bluedinosaur

Now create a Super User for the Admin Panel.

  => python manage.py createsuperuser

Add your name, email address and create a password. Write this down and keep it safe or just memorise it.

In the terminal type the following:

  => python manage.py Runserver

In the URl add /admin like below:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Then apply your require credentials.

After the Admin type the following:

  => python manage.py startapp gwangi  (Gwangi is a famous blue dinosaur so couldn't resist)
